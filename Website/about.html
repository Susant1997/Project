    <h1>About the Owner</h1>
    <p>Riji Shinoj, a young graceful dancer who never wanted to give up her talent and she, wanted it pr√§cticed and perfermed. so. it stayed, same. She did her degree in performing arts from
      Kalakshetra, Thrissur, India. When she arrived in New Zealand, she could not find any dance schools near by to practice what she learned from her home, country, India. She founded few
      schools and those were more than, 200kms distant and was not practical for her to travel every day leaving her husband and kids. home. Then she decided to practice at home but had a lot of:limitations. In between she performed on a stage
      show, and she was contacted by several other young ladies who watched her performance, showed their interest in learning and performing dance.
      There she decided to bring up everyone who are interested in dance to fly with their dreams.
